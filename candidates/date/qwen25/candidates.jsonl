After March 20, there are 11 more days in March.\n- April has 30 days.\n- May has 31 days.\n- June has 30 days.\n- July has 31 days.\n- August has 31 days.\n- September has 30 days.\n\nAdding these up:\n- 11 days in March = 11\n- 30 days in April = 30\n- 31 days in May = 31\n- 30 days in June = 30\n- 31 days in July = 31\n- 31 days in August = 31\n- 30 days in September = 30\n\nTotal so far: 11 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 = 204 days.\n\nSince we have 176 days to account for, we subtract the 204 days from our total:\n176 - 204 = -28\n\nThis negative value indicates that we've gone back 28 days from the initial count. This means the date is actually 28 days before March 20, 2020.\n\nCalculating 28 days back:\n- 28 days before March 20 is February 12, 2020.\n\nSo, 176 days after March 20, 2020 is February 12, 2020.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the date one week ago from today\n\nToday is February 12, 2020. One week ago would be:\nFebruary 12 - 7 days = February 5, 2020.\n\nTherefore, the date one week ago from today is February 5, 2020.\n\nLooking at the given options:\nA. 09/06/2020\nB. 08/15/2020\nC. 09/04/2020\nD. 02/05/2021\nE. 09/05/2020\n\nThe correct answer is February 5, 2020, which does not appear in the options provided. Therefore, none of the given options match the calculated date.\n\nThe best answer is [None of the above].

Determine the current date:\n   - Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020.\n   - 176 days have passed since then.\n\n2. Calculate the current date:\n   - Counting backwards 176 days from March 20, 2020:\n     - March has 31 days. From March 20 to March 31, that's 11 days.\n     - April has 30 days. After subtracting these 11 days, we have 19 days left in April.\n     - May has 31 days. Subtracting these 19 days leaves us with 12 days in May.\n     - June has 30 days. Subtracting these 12 days leaves us with 8 days in June.\n     - July has 31 days. Subtracting these 8 days leaves us with 23 days in July.\n     - August has 31 days. Subtracting these 23 days leaves us with 8 days in August.\n   - So, 176 days from March 20, 2020, lands on August 8, 2020.\n\n3. Calculate the date one week ago from today:\n   - If today is August 8, 2020, one week ago would be August 1, 2020.\n\n4.

So, counting from March 20 to the end of March gives us 11 days (March 20 to March 31).\n   - From April onward, we can subtract these 11 days from the total 176 days, leaving us with 165 days.\n   - April has 30 days, so counting from April 1 to April 30 leaves us with 30 days.\n   - From May onward, we can subtract these 30 days from the remaining 165 days, leaving us with 135 days.\n   - June has 30 days, so counting from June 1 to June 30 leaves us with 30 days.\n   - From July onward, we can subtract these 30 days from the remaining 135 days, leaving us with 35 days.\n   - Finally, August has 31 days, and counting 31 days from the beginning of August will give us 2 days left over (since we've already counted 31 days).\n   - Therefore, Jane quit her job 176 days before the current date, which would be approximately August 2, 2020.\n\n3. **What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY format?**\n   - Let's assume today is August 2, 2020 (as per our calculation above).\n   - One week ago from today (August 2) would be August 2 - 7 = August 29, 2020.\n\nNow, let's look at the provided options:\n- A. 09/06/2020\n- B. 08/15/2020\n- C. 09/04/2020\n- D. 02/05/2021\n- E. 09/05/2020\n\nNone of these dates match August 29, 2020.
