We need to find the date today.\n\n1.  **Calculate the arrival date of 2015:** 2015 is in 36 hours, which is 36 / 24 = 1.5 days. So, 2015 will be 1.5 days after today.\n\n2.  **Determine the current date:** Since 2015 is 1.5 days after today, we need to subtract 1.5 days from today.

However, days must be whole numbers.\nLet's consider the difference between 2015 and the current year.  2015 is 1 year after 2014. So, 2015 - 2014 = 1.\nThus, 2015 is 1 year and 1 day after 2014.\n2014 is a leap year. So, 2014 has 366 days.\nSo, 2015 - 2014 = 1 day. Therefore, 2015 is 1 day after 2014.\n2014 + 1 = 2015.\nIf today is 12/08/2014, then 2015 is 36 hours later, which is 2015 + 1.5 = 2016.5 days. This is not an integer.\n\nLet's consider the days from today.\nToday is 12/08/2014. 2015 is 36 hours from today.\n36 hours is 2 days.\nSo, 2014 + 2 = 2016.\nHowever, we need to find the date.\n\n2015 is 36 hours from today.\nIf today is 12/08/2014, then 2015 is 36 hours from 12/08/2014.\n2015 - 2014 = 1 day. 36 hours is 2 days.\nSo, 12/08/2014 + 2 days = 12/10/2014.\nBut this is not correct.\n\nThe problem states 2015 is coming in 36 hours.
