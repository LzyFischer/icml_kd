We need to find out what the current date is in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nTo proceed, let's assume the current date is DD/MM/YYYY. Since we know 2015 is starting in 36 hours, we can calculate the date as follows:\n\n- If it's currently the last day of December (i.e., 31st), then:\n  - 36 hours from 11:59 PM on the 31st would be 3:24 AM on the 1st of January 2015.\n  - But since we are looking for today's date, it must be December 31st.\n\nNow, let's check which option corresponds to December 31st in the format MM/DD/YYYY:\n\nA. 12/29/1974 - Incorrect, because this is not in the current year.\nB. 12/27/2014 - Incorrect, because this is before 2015.\nC. 12/29/2014 - Incorrect, because this is after 2015.\nD. 12/08/2014 - Incorrect, because this is before 2015.\nE. 12/22/2014 - Incorrect, because this is before 2015.\nF. 12/26/2014 - Incorrect, because this is before 2015.\n\nSince none of these options seem to fit correctly, let's consider if there was a misunderstanding or error in interpreting the question. Given that 2015 is coming in 36 hours, the only logical conclusion is that the current date must be December 31st, 2014.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\nThe best answer is C.", "source": "teacher_generated"}
