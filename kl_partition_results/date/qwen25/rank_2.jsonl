Determine the current date:\n   - Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020.\n   - 176 days have passed since then.\n\n2. Calculate the current date:\n   - Counting backwards 176 days from March 20, 2020:\n     - March has 31 days. From March 20 to March 31, that's 11 days.\n     - April has 30 days. After subtracting these 11 days, we have 19 days left in April.\n     - May has 31 days. Subtracting these 19 days leaves us with 12 days in May.\n     - June has 30 days. Subtracting these 12 days leaves us with 8 days in June.\n     - July has 31 days. Subtracting these 8 days leaves us with 23 days in July.\n     - August has 31 days. Subtracting these 23 days leaves us with 8 days in August.\n   - So, 176 days from March 20, 2020, lands on August 8, 2020.\n\n3.
