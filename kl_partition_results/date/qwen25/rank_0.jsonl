Therefore, the remaining number of days to reach 176 days is 176 - 11 = 165 days.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many months these 165 days correspond to:\n- April has 30 days, so after March 31, we have 30 - 11 = 19 days left in April.\n- May has 31 days, so after adding the 19 days from April, we have 165 - 19 = 146 days left.\n- June has 30 days, so after adding the 146 days from April and May, we have 165 - 146 = 19 days left in June.\n- July has 31 days, so after adding the 19 days from June, we have 165 - 31 = 134 days left.\n- August has 31 days, so after adding the 134 days from July, we have 165 - 31 = 134 days left in August.\n- September has 30 days, so after adding the 134 days from August, we have 165 - 30 = 134 days left in September.\n- October has 31 days, so after adding the 134 days from September, we have 165 - 31 = 134 days left in October.\n- November has 30 days, so after adding the 134 days from October, we have 165 - 30 = 134 days left in November.\n- December has 31 days, so after adding the 134 days from November, we have 165 - 31 = 134 days left in December.\n- January has 31 days, so after adding the 134 days from December, we have 165 - 31 = 134 days left in January.\n- February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so after adding the 134 days from January, we have 165 - 28 = 137 days left in February.\n\nSince we need exactly 176 days, we can see that February has 28 days, so the 176th day would be 176 - 28 = 148 days into the next year, which is March.\n\nThus, 176 days after March 20, 2020 is March 20, 2021.\n\nNow, we need to find the date a month ago from this date (March 20, 2021) which is February 20, 2021.\n\nLooking at the given options, the correct date a month ago from March 20, 2021 is:\n\nThe best answer is [C].", "source": "teacher_generated"}
