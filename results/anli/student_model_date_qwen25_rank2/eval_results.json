The statement says that the entire Bay Area fell into a drought again during the summer.\n2. The drought is not happening in the Bay Area.\n3. The drought is happening during a dry season.\n4. The drought will accelerate if the wet season is drier than normal.\n\nThe question asks if it does not rain in the Bay Area. This means that the drought is not happening in the Bay Area, but it is happening during a dry season. The statement explicitly states that the drought is happening during a dry season, which means the drought is not happening in the Bay Area.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: False.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{False}.",

One day, the power went out. Taylor quickly went to get candles. She had to drive to the store. After that, she had light in her new home\" can be interpreted as:\n     - If Taylor bought a house, then she bought candles.\n     - If she bought candles, then she had light in her new home.\n     - If she had light in her new home, then the power went out.\n\n3. **Determine the logical relationship:**\n   - The statement clearly states that if Taylor bought a house, then she bought candles. This means that if Taylor bought a house, then she had candles. However, the statement also states that if she had light in her new home, then the power went out. This means that if she had light in her new home, then the power went out. Therefore, the power went out if and only if Taylor had candles.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The power went out if and only if Taylor had candles. This means that the power went out if and only if Taylor bought candles. Since the power went out, Taylor must have bought candles. Therefore, the power went out if and only if Taylor bought candles.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the correct answer is that the power went out if and only if Taylor bought candles.

Therefore, this method is indeed applicable for cleaning quartz.\n\n2. **If you have a large amount of quartz with a heavy amount of mud or dirt on it, you can try to rinse it off with a power washer.**\n   - This method is also applicable.

It is generally considered a last resort and is not used in most legal systems. The death penalty is often reserved for cases where the crime is considered extremely heinous and the victim is a child.\n\n2. **Ethical Considerations**: The death penalty is often seen as a form of punishment that is not justifiable or justifiable in most legal systems. It is often used as a last resort and is not a fair or just punishment. The death penalty is often seen as a form of cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nGiven these considerations, the statement \"Children can be given the death penalty\" is not true. In many legal systems, the death penalty is not a recognized method of punishment and is not used in most legal contexts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: **False**. \n\nFinal answer: False. \n\nThe statement is false. Children cannot be given the death penalty. The correct answer is False. \n\nThe final answer is: False. \n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python code snippet to illustrate the reasoning:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to check the statement\ndef check_statement():\n    # Define the statement\n    statement = \"Children can be given the death penalty.\"\n    \n    # Define the correct answer\n    correct_answer = False\n    \n    # Check the statement\n    if statement == \"Children can be given the death penalty\":\n        correct_answer = True\n    else:\n        correct_answer = False\n    \n    return correct_answer\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nresult = check_statement()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe output of the code will be `False`, confirming our earlier reasoning.

Let's denote the total number of votes as \\( V \\).
