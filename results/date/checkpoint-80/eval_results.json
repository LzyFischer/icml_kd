However, since the question asks for the date 24 hours later, and the closest logical answer from the given options would be the next day in the same year, the correct answer should be the next day in November 2001.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. 12/01/2001, which is the next day in the same year.\n\nThe best answer is D.",

Calculate 10 days ago from Jan 2, 1963:\n   - Jan 2, 1963\n   - Jan 3, 1963\n   - Jan 4, 1963\n   - Jan 5, 1963\n   - Jan 6, 1963\n   - Jan 7, 1963\n   - Jan 8, 1963\n   - Jan 9, 1963\n   - Jan 10, 1963 (10 days ago)\n   - Jan 11, 1963 (10 days ago)\n\n5. The date 10 days ago from Jan 2, 1963 is Jan 11, 1963.\n\n6.

None of the options match the date we calculated (Jan 11, 1963).\n\nGiven that none of the provided options match the correct date, it seems there might be an error in the problem statement or the options provided.
