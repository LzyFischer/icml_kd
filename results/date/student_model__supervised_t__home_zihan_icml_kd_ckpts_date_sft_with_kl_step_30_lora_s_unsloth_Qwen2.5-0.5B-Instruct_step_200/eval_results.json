Since 1966 is a leap year, the third month is March. Therefore, the date is March 2nd.\n\n2. **Determine the day of the week**: March 2nd is the second day of the third month, which means it is the second day of the third month. Since the date is in the third month, the day must be the second day of the month. Thus, the day is 2nd.\n\n3. **Determine the year**: The question does not provide the year, but we know the month and day, so we can infer that the year is 1966.\n\n4. **Calculate the date yesterday**: Since today is March 2nd, the date yesterday would be March 1st.\n\n5. **Match the date with the given options**: The date yesterday is March 1st, which corresponds to option D.\n\nThe best answer is [D. 03/01/1966].

The date one week from today is February 2012.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\nA. 02/06/2012 - This is the date one week from today, which is February 2012.\nB. 02/07/2014 - This is the date one week from today, which is February 2012.\nC. 03/16/2012 - This is the date one week from today, which is February 2012.\nD. 02/01/2012 - This is the date one week from today, which is February 2012.\nE. 02/07/2012 - This is the date one week from today, which is February 2012.\nF. 01/31/2012 - This is the date one week from today, which is February 2012.\n\nThe best answer is [A. 02/06/2012].
