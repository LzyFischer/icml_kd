      "generated": " Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the date 10 days ago from the palindrome day of 2020.\n\n1. **Identify the palindrome day:**\n   - The palindrome day in 2020 is given as MM/DD/YYYY.\n   - The MM/DD/YYYY format is the same when read forwards and backwards.\n   - Given the format, we need to find a date where the month (MM) and day (DD) are the same when reversed.\n\n2. **Find the palindrome day in 2020:**\n   - We need to check the dates in 2020 to find a palindrome.\n   - The possible dates are 01/01/2020, 02/02/2020, 03/03/2020, 04/04/2020, 05/05/2020, 06/06/2020, 07/07/2020, 08/08/2020, 09/09/2020, and 10/10/2020.\n   - Among these, the only date that fits the MM/DD/YYYY format and is a palindrome is 10/10/2020.\n\n3. **Calculate the date 10 days ago from 10/10/2020:**\n   - We need to subtract 10 days from 10/10/2020.\n   - 10/10/2020 - 10 days = 9/21/2020.\n\n4. **Verify the palindrome day:**\n   - Check if 09/21/2020 is a palindrome.\n   - Reading forwards: 09/21/2020\n   - Reading backwards: 02/19/2020 (which is not a palindrome)\n   - Therefore, 09/21/2020 is not a palindrome.\n\n5. **Re-evaluate the possible dates:**\n   - Since 10/10/2020 is the only known palindrome day, we need to recheck the problem constraints.\n   - The problem states today is the palindrome day, so we need to find the date 10 days ago from 10/10/2020.\n\n6. **Re-calculate the date 10 days ago from 10/10/2020:**\n   - 10/10/2020 - 10 days = 9/21/2020 (as previously calculated).\n\n7. **Check the given options:**\n   - Option A: 01/23/2011 (not a palindrome)\n   - Option B: 01/23/2020 (not the same as 10/10/2020)\n   - Option C: 03/23/2020 (not the same as 10/10/2020)\n   - Option D: 01/23/2078 (not a palindrome)\n   - Option E: 01/22/2020 (not the same as 10/10/2020)\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only date that fits the problem constraints and is a palindrome is 10/10/2020.\n   - Therefore, 10 days ago from 10/10/2020 is 9/21/2020, but since 9/21/2020 is not a palindrome, we need to re-evaluate the problem.\n\nGiven the constraints and the options provided, the closest and most logical answer is:\n\nThe best answer is [].\n(Note: The provided options do not include the correct date 10 days ago from 10/10/2020, which is 9/21/2020, but since it is not a palindrome, the closest logical answer from the given options is not available.)
