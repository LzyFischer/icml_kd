Find the current year:** The current year is 2001.\n2001 + 4 = 2005\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo, the current year is 2005.\n2005 - 18 = 1923\nSo,",
