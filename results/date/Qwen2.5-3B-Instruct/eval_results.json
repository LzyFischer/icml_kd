Given that it's May 6, 1992, ten years ago would be May 6, 1982.\n\nNow, to find the date \"yesterday\" to Jane, which is May 6, 1982, we need to determine what date was yesterday to Jane before she thought it was May 6, 1982. Since she thought it was yesterday, she must have thought it was May 5, 1982.\n\nSo, the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY format is 05/05/1982.\n\nNow, let's compare this with the given options:\n\nA. 05/26/2002\nB. 05/05/1902\nC. 05/05/2002\nD. 05/01/2002\nE. 05/05/2084\nF. 05/05/2001\n\nThe correct date is 05/05/1982, which matches option B.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B.\n\nThe best answer is B.",

Calculate the date one week ago from today (11/21/2020):\n   - One week is 7 days.\n   - Subtract 7 days from 11/21/2020.\n\n3. Perform the subtraction:\n   - 11/21 - 7 = 10/14/2020.\n   - Since 14 is not a valid day in the MM/DD format, we need to adjust.\n   - 14 - 12 (since 12 is a valid day) = 2.\n   - So, the date one week ago is 10/02/2020.\n\n4. Compare the calculated date with the options provided:\n   - A. 01/26/2020 (January 26, 2020)\n   - B. 11/15/2019 (November 15, 2019)\n   - C. 01/26/1980 (January 26, 1980)\n   - D. 01/19/2020 (January 19, 2020)\n   - E. 01/27/2020 (January 27, 2020)\n   - F. 11/21/2019 (November 21, 2019)\n\nThe calculated date 10/02/2020 does not match any of the provided options. However, since none of the options match the calculated date, we need to find the closest match. The closest option to 10/02/2020 is F. 11/21/2019, which is the date one week before 11/21/2020.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is F.\n\nThe best answer is F.",
