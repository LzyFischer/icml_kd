people, the total number of appointments is 3.\n\n3. **Determine the total number of days:**\n   - Since there are 3 appointments and 5 people, the total number of days is 3.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of days from the given date:**\n   - The given date is 7/9/1972.\n   - The total number of days from 7/9/1972 to 7/31/1972 is 31 - 9 = 22 days.\n\n5. **Determine the number of appointments in 22 days:**\n   - Since there are 3 appointments per day, the total number of appointments in 22 days is 3 * 22 = 66 appointments.\n\n6. **Determine the total number of appointments in 24 hours:**\n   - Since there are 66 appointments, the total number of appointments in 24 hours is 66 / 24 = 2.75 appointments.\n\n7. **Determine the total number of days from the given date:**\n   - Since there are 3 appointments and 5 people, the total number of days from 7/9/1972 to 7/31/1972 is 31 - 9 = 22 days.\n   - Since there are 2.75 appointments in 22 days, the total number of appointments in 24 hours is 2.75 * 24 = 66 appointments.\n\n8. **Determine the date 24 hours later:**\n   - Since there are 66 appointments in 24 hours, the date 24 hours later is

December has 31 days, so 12 months from December 31, 1929, would be December 31 - 12 months.\n2.
