Since today is the US Thanksgiving of 2001, we need to find the date a month ago from 2001.\n2. 2001 is not a leap year, so it has 365 days. The fourth Thursday of November in 2001 would be the 22nd of November.\n3. To find the date a month ago from 2001, we subtract 1 month from 2001. Since 2001 is not a leap year, November has 31 days. So, the date a month ago would be the 21st of the previous month, which is October.\n4. Therefore, the date a month ago from 2001 is 10/21/2002.\n\nThe best answer is [10/21/2002].
