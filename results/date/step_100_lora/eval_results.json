      "generated": " Step 1: Calculate the number of days Jane had eggs.\nJane bought 40 eggs and ate one per day. Therefore, she had eggs for 40 days.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of days from May 9th, 2017 to the current date.\nSince Jane ran out of eggs, we need to find the current date. We know that she had eggs for 40 days, so the current date is 40 days after May 9th, 2017.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the date one year ago from today.\nTo find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 365 days from the current date.\n\nStep 4: Determine the current date.\nSince Jane had eggs for 40 days, we need to add 40 days to May 9th, 2017. Adding 40 days to May 9th, 2017, we get June 18th, 2017.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the date one year ago from June 18th, 2017.\nOne year ago from June 18th, 2017, is June 18th, 2016.\n\nStep 6: Check the given options.\nThe only option that matches June 18th, 2016 is C.\n\nThe best answer is C.

13 = 352 days from the first Monday of 2014.\n352 / 7 = 50 weeks and 2 days.\nSo, 2 days before the first Monday of 2014 (13th January 2014) is the 11th of January 2013.\n\nStep 14: Determine the date of the first Monday of 2013.\nThe first Monday of 2013 would be 6 days after the 11th of January 2013, which is the 17th of January 2013.\n\nStep 15: Determine the date one year ago from the first Monday of 2013.\nOne year ago from the first Monday of 2013 (17th January 2013) would be the first Monday of 2012.\n2013 is not a leap year, so it has 365 days.\n365 - 17 = 348 days from the first Monday of 2013.\n348 / 7 = 49 weeks and 5 days.\nSo, 5 days before the first Monday of 2013 (17th January 2013) is the 12th of January 2012.\n\nStep 16: Determine the date of the first Monday of 2012.\nThe first Monday of 2012 would be 6 days after the 12th of January 2012, which is the 18th of January 2012.\n\nStep 17: Determine the date one year ago from the first Monday of 2012.\nOne year ago from the first Monday of 2012 (18th January 2012) would be the first Monday of 2011.\n2012 is a leap year, so it has 366 days.\n366 - 18 = 348 days from the first Monday of 2012.\n348 / 7 = 49 weeks and 5 days.\nSo, 5 days before the first Monday of 2012 (18th January 2012) is the 13th of January 2011.\n\nStep 18: Determine the date of the first Monday of 2011.\nThe first Monday of 2011 would be 6 days after the 13th of January 2011, which is the 19th of January 2011.\n\nStep 19: Determine the date one year ago from the first Monday of 2011.\nOne year ago from the first Monday of 2011 (19th January 2011) would be the first Monday of 2010.\n2011 is not a leap year, so it has 365 days.\n365 - 19 = 346 days from the first Monday of 2011.\n346 / 7 = 49 weeks and 3 days.\nSo, 3 days before the first Monday of 2011 (19th January 2011) is the 16th of January 2010.\n\nStep 20: Determine the date of the first Monday of 2010.\nThe first Monday of 2010 would be 6 days after the 16th of January 2010, which is the 22nd of January 20",
