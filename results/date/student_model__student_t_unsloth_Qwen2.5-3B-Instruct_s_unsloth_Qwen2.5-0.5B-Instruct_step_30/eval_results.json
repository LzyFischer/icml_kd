      "generated": " Let's start by determining the date of the first day of 2019. Since the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, we can use the fact that the days of the week repeat every 7 days to find the date of the first day of 2019. \n\n2019 is a leap year, so it has 366 days. Since the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, the first day of 2019 would be the 2nd of February. Therefore, the first day of 2019 is February 2nd.\n\nNow, we need to find the date 10 days ago from February 2nd. Since February 2nd is a Tuesday, 10 days from February 2nd would be the 12th of February. Therefore, the date 10 days ago is February 12th.\n\nThe best answer is [E. 12/14/2018].
