We need to find the date today in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nThe fourth Thursday of November in 2001 is within the year 2001. Therefore, the date for this year would be November 14, 2001.\n\nThe question asks for the date in MM/DD/YYYY format. Given that November 14, 2001, is the fourth Thursday, we need to count the days from November 14, 2001, to November 30, 2001.\n\n1. November 14 (Thursday) + 12 days = November 26 (Thursday)\n2. November 26 (Thursday) + 11 days = November 27 (Friday)\n3. November 27 (Friday) + 11 days = November 30 (Friday)\n4. November 30 (Friday) + 10 days = December 8 (Saturday)\n5. December 8 (Saturday) + 11 days = December 15 (Sunday)\n6. December 15 (Sunday) + 11 days = December 28 (Monday)\n7. December 28 (Monday) + 10 days = December 29 (Tuesday)\n8. December 29 (Tuesday) + 11 days = December 30 (Wednesday)\n9.

The first quarter of 2008 typically spans from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2007. However, since it's the last day of the first quarter, we can assume the 1st quarter starts from January 1, 2008, and ends on December 31, 2007. Thus, today is the 30th day of the first quarter, which is March 30, 2008.\n\n2. **Calculate the date one week ago**: One week ago from March 30, 2008, would be March 30 - 7 days. Since today is the 30th, we need to count back 7 days from today.\n\n3. **Count the days backwards**: From March 30, 2008, count back 7 days. March has 31 days, so we skip the 30th day and count backwards to the 21st day. This leaves us with 21 days to count back. March has 31 days, so we skip the 21st day and count backwards to the 10th day. This leaves us with 10 days to count back. March has 31 days, so we skip the 10th day and count backwards to the 9th day. This leaves us with 9 days to count back. March has 31 days, so we skip the 9th day and count backwards to the 8th day. This leaves us with 8 days to count back. March has 31 days, so we skip the 8th day and count backwards to the 7th day. This leaves us with 7 days to count back. March has 31 days, so we skip the 7th day and count backwards to the 6th day. This leaves us with 6 days to count back. March has 31 days, so we skip the 6th day and count backwards to the 5th day. This leaves us with 5 days to count back. March has 31 days, so we skip the 5th day and count backwards to the 4th day. This leaves us with 4 days to count back. March has 31 days, so we skip the 4th day and count backwards to the 3rd day. This leaves us with 3 days to count back. March has 31 days, so we skip the 3rd day and count backwards to the 2nd day. This leaves us with 2 days to count back. March has 31 days, so we skip the 2nd day and count backwards to the 1st day. This leaves us with 1 day to count back. March has 31 days, so we skip the 1st day and count backwards to the 0th day. This leaves us with 0 days to count back.
