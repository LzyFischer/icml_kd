Subtract 1 month from 11/30/1899.\n   - 11/30/1899 becomes 10/30/1898 (because 12/31/1899 is 13/31/1899, we subtract 1 month from 11/30/1899).\n3. The previous month is 10/30/1898.\n4. Subtract the day from the previous month:\n   - 10/30/1898 becomes 09/30/1898 (because 10/30/1898 is the day before the month 10/30/1898).\n5. Add 12/31/1899 to the previous month:\n   - 09/30/1898 + 12/31/1899 = 09/30/1899.\n\nTherefore, the date a month ago is 09/30/1899.\n\nThe best answer is [].\n\nThe answer is: []",

Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Start Date**: 9/7\n2. **Subtract 10 days**:\n   - 10 days from 9/7 is 8/7.\n   - Since 8/7 is a fraction of the week, we need to adjust for the fact that 10 days from 9/7 is not a whole day but a fraction of the week.\n\n3. **Adjusting for Fraction**:\n   - 8/7 is 8 days and 1/7 of a day. So, 10 days from 9/7 means we need to add 9 days to the 8/7 date.\n   - 9 days from 9/7 is 8/7 + 9/7 = 17/7.\n   - 17/7 is 2 days and 3/7 of a day. So, 10 days from 9/7 is 8/7 + 2/7 = 10/7.\n   - 10/7 is 14/7 = 2 whole days. So, 10 days from 9/7 is 8/7 + 2/7 = 10/7, which is 10 days after 9/7.\n\n4. **Final Date**: 10/7 is 10/7, which is 10/7 of the week. Since 10/7 is 10 days after 9/7, we need to convert it back to the format MM/DD/YYYY.\n\n5. **Convert 10/7 to MM/DD/YYYY**:\n   - 10/7 is 10/7 of the week, which is 10/7 of the week.\n   - 10/7 of the week is 10/7 of the week, which is 10/7 of the week.\n   - 10/7 of the week is 10/7 of the week, which is 10/7 of the week.\n\nTherefore, the date 10 days ago from 9/7 is 10/7, which is 10/7 of the week.

Determine the day of the week for today.\n3. Use the day of the week to find the date in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the date of the US Thanksgiving in 2001\nThe US Thanksgiving in 2001 was on the fourth Thursday of November. Let's calculate the date:\n\n- The 4th Thursday of November in 2001 is October 29.\n- Therefore, the US Thanksgiving in 2001 was on October 29.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the day of the week for today\nToday is the US Thanksgiving of 2001. We need to find the day of the week for October 29, 2001. We can use the fact that the year 2001 is a leap year (divisible by 4) and a century year (divisible by 100), which means it is not a leap year. Therefore, October 29, 2001, is a Friday.\n\n### Step 3: Find the date in MM/DD/YYYY format\nNow that we know today is a Friday, we can determine the date in the format MM/DD/YYYY. In October, 2001, the month is October, and the day is 29. However, since October 29 is a Friday, the date in MM/DD/YYYY format is:\n\n- October: 29\n- November: 30\n- December: 31\n- January: 1\n- February: 2\n\nSo, the date in MM/DD/YYYY format is 11/29/2001.\n\nThe best answer is D. 11/23/2002.",

Subtract one day from that day to get yesterday's date.\n\nLet's start with step 1. November 2001 falls on a Tuesday. To find the day of the week, we can count backwards from Tuesday:\n\n- 2001 is a leap year, so it has 366 days.\n- 366 divided by 7 is 52 with a remainder of 2, so 366 is 2 days after a Tuesday.\n- Therefore, November 2001 is a Tuesday.\n\nNow, for step 2, we subtract one day from the day of the week:\n\n- 2001 - 1 = 2000\n- 2000 divided by 7 is 285 with a remainder of 5, so 2000 is 5 days after a Tuesday.\n- Therefore, 2000 is 5 days after a Tuesday, which is a Thursday.\n\nSo, yesterday in November 2001 was a Thursday.\n\nNow, we need to convert this date into the format MM/DD/YYYY.

Since February has 28 days in 2008, subtracting one month means subtracting 28 days. However, February 29th in 2008 is not a regular month. We need to account for leap years to ensure the month is correctly calculated.\n\n3. **Leap Year Check**: February 29th in a non-leap year is 29 days. Since 2008 is not a leap year, February 29th is 29 days from the start of the year. We need to subtract 29 days from the current date to get the date 1 month before.\n\n4. **Calculate the Date**: Subtract 29 days from 29th February of 2008.
