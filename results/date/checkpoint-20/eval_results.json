She ran out of eggs today.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many days have passed since May 9th, 2017.\n\n- May has 31 days.\n- From May 9th to May 31st, there are 22 days.\n- So, 40 eggs were eaten in 22 days, and she had 18 eggs left on May 31st.\n\nSince she ate one egg per day, she would have eaten 22 eggs in the first 22 days. This means she had 18 eggs left on May 31st.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many days have passed since May 31st, 2017, to today.\n\n- Jane ran out of eggs today, so she has eaten 40 eggs in total.\n- She had 18 eggs left on May 31st, so she must have eaten 40 - 18 = 22 more eggs after May 31st.\n\nSince she eats one egg per day, this means she has eaten 22 more eggs after May 31st, which means 22 more days have passed.\n\n- Today is 22 days after May 31st, 2017.\n- Adding 22 days to May 31st, 2017, we get June 22nd, 2017.\n\nNow, we need to find the date one week from today (June 22nd, 2017).\n\n- One week from June 22nd, 2017, is July 29th, 2017.\n\nHowever, none of the given options match July 29th, 2017.
