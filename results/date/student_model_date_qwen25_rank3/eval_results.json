Subtract one year from May 6, 1992.\n   - May 6, 1992, is a Friday.\n   - One year from May 6, 1992, would be May 6, 1993.\n\n3. Identify the day and month of May 6, 1993.\n   - May has 31 days, so May 6 is a Friday.\n   - The day is 6, and the month is 5.\n\nTherefore, one year ago from May 6, 1992, is May 6, 1993.\n\nThe best

Therefore, 2000 is not a leap year.\n\n2000/4000 = 0.5, so 2000 is not divisible by 4000, and the year is not divisible by 1000. Therefore, 2000 is not a leap year.\n\n2000/4000 = 0.5, so 2000 is not divisible by 4000, and the year is not divisible by 1000.

      "generated": " To determine the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify the current date. Since the question is about the last day of Jan 2012, we need to know the date for January 2012. January 2012 has 31 days, so the current date is January 31, 2012.\n2. Subtract one year from January 31, 2012. One year is 12 months, so we subtract 12 months from January 31, 2012. January has 31 days, so after subtracting 12 months, January will have 31 - 12 = 19 days left. January 31, 2012, is the last day of January 2012, so after subtracting 12 months, the date will be January 19, 2012.\n3. Now, we need to convert January 19, 2012, to the format MM/DD/YYYY. January has 31 days, so January 19, 2012, is the 19th day of the month. The date in MM/DD/YYYY format is 01/19/2012.\n\nTherefore, the date one year ago from today is 01/19/2012.

Determine the day of the week for the first Monday of 2019.\n3. Calculate the date one week from today.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the day of the week for the first day of 2019\nThe first day of 2019 is a Tuesday. Therefore, the first day of 2019 is the 1st day of the month.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the day of the week for the first Monday of 2019\nSince the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, the first Monday of 2019 will be the 1st Monday of the month. The first Monday of 2019 is the 1st Monday of the month, which is the 1st day of the month.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the date one week from today\nToday is the 1st day of the month. One week from today will be the 7th day of the month. Since today is the 1st day of the month, the 7th day of the month is the 1st day of the month plus 7 days.
