Since it's a leap year (2019 is a leap year), it has 29 days, which means the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday.\n\nNext, we need to determine the first Monday of 2019. A year with a leap year (2019) has 29 days, so the first Monday is the first day of the month. Since 2019 has 12 months, the first Monday is the 1st of January 2019.\n\nNow, we can determine the date yesterday.
